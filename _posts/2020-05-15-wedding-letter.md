Dear Dalton and Marina,

When the two of you queued up together almost a decade ago, you were your Bronze V noobs, barely old enough to heft a BF Sword and stumble down Mid. Love was a new game mode, equal parts terrifying and thrilling. No one told you the rules, and no one could. This was a custom game with mysterious mechanics discoverable only by trial and error.

And indeed, it was oftentimes a serious trial filled with errors. You face-checked bushes filled to bursting with dunking Dariuses. Your recalls when ruined by rampaging Rivens. You were sliced and stabbed, lazered and licked, bombarded, blasted, and burned. But through it all, you persevered. You stood together hand-in-hand against the onslaught, trusting in the strength and beauty of your love to survive the darkest, most desperate of days.

Through the act of playing together -- of pushing and turtling, of fighting and recalling, of winning and losing -- you built a Brand of teamwork so uniquely and powerfully yours that it carried you through years, through the ranks, and straight through to Challenger. No matter the odds, you fought on. No matter the team composition, you synergized. No matter which card Twisted Fate threw, you knew that your partner would come hurtling out of the Jungle, ready to defend you to the death against all comers.

Today, after years of waiting, the wedding queue has popped. Today, you accept the match and accept each other as your perfect matches. Today, the shared world you have carefully built over the last decade changes forever but changes for the better Today, Dalton and Marina, is yours.

Good luck, Summoners. May you terrorize the Rift for many years to come, stunning competitors with your tactical brilliance and dazzling them with your undying love.
